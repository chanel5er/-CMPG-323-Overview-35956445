# -Repository versus Project
A repository keeps track of all the data, files, history, and changes made to your code and the project. Basically it contains all the data pertaining to your project. A project is a visual representation of the overall progress. It keeps track of issues, pull request, deadlines, etc. 

# -Project Repositories
There is a total of 6 projects that need to be submitted during this semester. Each will have their own repository and seperate branches. The repositories are as follows:
  -CMPG-323-Overview-35956554
  -CMPG-323-Project-2-35956554
  -CMPG-323-Project-3-35956554
  -CMPG-323-Project-4-35956554
  -CMPG-323-Project-5-35956554
  -CMPG-323-Portfolio-of-Evidence-35956554
  
# -Branching Strategy
I will be using a continious development branching strategy througout the semester. Each project will have a seperate branch for creating and changing code. A pull request should be created for each branch whereby it is subject for review and unit testing. Only after receiving approval will the branch be merged into master. Hotfixes will only take place in the event that a major bug was picked up.

# -Sensitive and Private Data
Any sensitive and private data will be kept on seperate files that will be subject to .gitIgnore. Thus, keeping the integrity of the data safe and ensuring that the data remain confidential.
